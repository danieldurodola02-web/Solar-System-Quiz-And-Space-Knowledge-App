# Solar-System-Quiz-And-Space-Knowledge-App

Status: In Progress

This project is a simple quiz application that tests users on their knowledge of the solar system, astronomy, and basic space science.

I started this project to strengthen my Python skills, especially in:
 - Working with lists and dictionaries
 - Handling user input
 - Building a clean program structure
 - Designing simple text-based interfaces
 - Using modular functions

This is a work-in-progress project, and I’ll keep updating it as development continues.

# Features
 - Create a fun and interactive quiz about planets, stars, moons, comets, and general astronomy.
 - Multiple-choice quiz questions and score calculation at the end of each round
 - Add different difficulty levels (Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced).
 - Randomized question order
 - Clean, beginner-friendly Python code
 - “Ask the Universe” mode
 - User can ask common astronomy questions from my predefined question bank 
 - Program answers from a predefined knowledge list i have created

# How It Works
The quiz system is built using:
 - Lists and dictionaries to store questions
 - Functions to organize the quiz logic/structure
 - Loops for navigation and scoring
 - Simple command-line input and output

This is the first version though,and I will keep improving the structure overtime.

# How to Run
 1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.
	2. Download the file main.py
	3. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
 4. Choose:
 - Quiz mode
 - Difficulty level
 - Number of questions

# Example Output

 - For quiz,you will see:
	- Questions and multiple-choice answers
	- Score summary at the end
	- Correct/incorrect feedback
	- A simple results breakdown
 - For ask-the-universe mode,you will see:
 . predefined list of questions 
 . Answer to your choice of question

# Why I Built This

I created this project to practice:
	•	Writing clean and structured Python code
	•	Handling user input
	•	Building simple software applications
	•	Improving my problem-solving and programming structure
	•	Creating real projects to showcase my growth,and i believe it is educational,engaging,and fun.

I will continue expanding this app with new levels and the “Ask the Universe” feature overtime.
