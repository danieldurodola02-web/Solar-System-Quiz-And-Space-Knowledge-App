# Solar-System-Quiz-And-Space Knowledge-App  

This project is a simple quiz application that tests users on their knowledge of the Solar System, astronomy, and basic space science.  

I started this project to strengthen my Python skills, especially in:  
- Working with lists and dictionaries  
- Handling user input  
- Building a clean program structure  
- Designing simple text-based interfaces  
- Using modular functions  

This is a work-in-progress project, and I’ll keep updating it as development continues.  

## Features  
- Create a fun and interactive quiz about planets, stars, moons, comets, and general astronomy.  
- Multiple-choice quiz questions with score calculation at the end of each round.  
- Add different difficulty levels (Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced).  
- Randomized question order to keep the quiz engaging.  
- Clean, beginner-friendly Python code suitable for learning and modification.
- **“Ask the Universe” mode**:  
  - Users can ask common astronomy questions from a predefined knowledge list.  
  - The program attempts to answer questions intelligently based on keyword matching.  

## How It Works  
The quiz system is built using:  
- **Lists and dictionaries** to store questions and answers.  
- **Functions** to organize quiz logic, scoring, and navigation.  
- **Loops** for iterating through questions and handling user input.  
- **Simple command-line input/output** for an interactive experience.  

This is the first version, and I will keep improving the structure over time.  

## How to Run  
1. Make sure **Python 3** is installed on your system.  
2. Download the file `main.py`.  
3. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:  
4. Choose your preferred option:  
   - Quiz mode  
   - Difficulty level  
   - Number of questions  

## Example Output  

**Quiz Mode:**  
- Displays questions with multiple-choice answers.  
- Shows correct/incorrect feedback after each question.  
- Provides a final score summary and simple results breakdown.  

**Ask-the-Universe Mode:**  
- Users type questions about space.  
- The program provides answers from a predefined knowledge bank.  

## Why I Built This  
I created this project to practice:  
- Writing clean and structured Python code  
- Handling user input efficiently  
- Building simple software applications  
- Improving problem-solving and programming structure  
- Creating real projects to showcase my growth
- And lastly because i love Physics and Space exploration 

I believe this project is educational, engaging, and fun. I will continue expanding the app with new difficulty levels and enhancements to the **Ask-the-Universe** feature over time.
