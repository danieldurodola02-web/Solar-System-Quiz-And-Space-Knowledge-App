# Solar-System-Quiz-And-Space-Knowledge-App

This project is a simple quiz application that tests users on their knowledge of the solar system, astronomy, and basic space science.

I started this project to strengthen my Python skills, especially in:
-Working with lists and dictionaries
-Handling user input
-Building a clean program structure
-Designing simple text-based interfaces
-Using modular functions

This is a work-in-progress project, and I’ll keep updating it as I learn more.
